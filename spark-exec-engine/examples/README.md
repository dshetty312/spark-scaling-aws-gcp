This code does the following:

We define a Record class to represent our data structure, including a key, date, and other data.
We create a sample input RDD with some test data.
We convert the input RDD to a PairRDD, using the key field as the key.
We apply reduceByKey operation, which will group records by key and then apply our custom reduction function.
The reduction function compares the dates of two records and returns the one with the later date.
After deduplication, we convert the result back to a regular RDD if needed.
Finally, we print the results.

When you run this code, it will output:
CopyKey: 1, Date: 2023-05-02, Data: Data B
Key: 2, Date: 2023-05-01, Data: Data C
Note that this example assumes the date is in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. If your date format is different, you'll need to adjust the SimpleDateFormat accordingly.
Also, keep in mind that this example loads all data into memory for the collect() operation at the end. In a real-world scenario with large datasets, you'd typically write the results to a file or database instead of collecting them to the driver.
